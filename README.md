# note-taker

## Description

In this project I created server.js to provide a back end for pre-existing front end code and complete a note taking application that keeps notes stored on a server.  The server stores notes in a JSON file.  The user can create notes, retrieve previously created notes, and delete notes that are no longer needed.
